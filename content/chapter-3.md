Now that the reader understands requests and responses, we zoom out slightly. What *is* this thing that's answering?

## A Server is Just a Computer That Waits

- It's not a special device — it's software running on a machine
- Its job: listen for requests, send back responses
- Demystify the word "server" — it serves, like a waiter or a librarian

## Files on a Shelf

- At its simplest, a web server is a program that knows where files live
- When you ask for `/about.html`, it finds that file and sends it back
- This is called "static" serving — the files don't change based on who asks

## The Server as a Patient Shopkeeper

- Open for business, waiting for visitors
- Doesn't reach out to you — you have to come to it
- Many customers can visit at once, each gets their own response

## Where Do Servers Live?

- Your laptop can be a server (locally)
- Data centers: warehouses full of servers
- The "cloud" is just someone else's computer — demystify the term

## What a Server Doesn't Do

- It doesn't display pages (that's the browser's job)
- It doesn't know who you are unless you tell it
- It doesn't remember previous requests by default (statelessness — light touch)

### Tone for this chapter

Warm and grounding. The server should feel accessible — something anyone could run if they wanted to. The metaphor of a small shop or library works well. Not a fortress, not a mystery — just a place.

### Bridge to Chapter 4

We've met the browser (the asker), the server (the answerer), and seen the exchange. But how do they understand each other? That's HTTP — the shared language.
