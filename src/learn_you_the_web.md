# Learn You the Web

### (for Real This Time)

Once upon a time, the web was just a polite question and an honest answer. A browser asked for a page, a server replied, and that was the whole miracle. The web you use today is still built on that same exchange—it just wears a lot more armor. This book explains how that armor came to be, what purpose it serves, and how you can use it wisely, so hosting and protecting your own corner of the web becomes something you understand, not something you avoid.
