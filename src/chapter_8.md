### Key Ideas

The final chapter brings everything back to the reader. This is about ownership, agency, and the quiet joy of running your own piece of the web.

**Core concepts to cover:**

1. **You don't need permission**
   - The web was built to be decentralized
   - Anyone can run a server, serve pages, join the conversation
   - This isn't nostalgia — it's still true today

2. **What does "hosting" actually mean?**
   - Having a server that's reachable on the internet
   - Pointing a domain name at it
   - Keeping it running and responding

3. **The minimal setup**
   - A small VPS (Virtual Private Server)
   - A domain name
   - A web server (Nginx, Caddy) or a reverse proxy like Sentinel
   - Let's Encrypt for HTTPS
   - That's it. That's a real website.

4. **Responsibilities of ownership**
   - Security: keeping your server safe from misuse
   - Maintenance: updates, backups, monitoring
   - Availability: making sure it stays up
   - These aren't burdens — they're care

5. **Sentinel in context**
   - If you're running your own corner, Sentinel can be the doorman
   - Security-focused, designed for people who want control
   - Not a replacement for understanding — a tool that respects your understanding

6. **The free web is worth protecting**
   - Corporate platforms are convenient but have costs (data, control, dependency)
   - Running your own server is an act of independence
   - It doesn't have to be big — a personal site, a blog, a small API
   - What matters is that it's *yours*

7. **You now have the map**
   - Requests and responses (Chapters 1-2)
   - Servers (Chapter 3)
   - HTTP (Chapter 4)
   - Reverse proxies (Chapter 5)
   - Encryption (Chapter 6)
   - Scale (Chapter 7)
   - And now: your own corner

### Tone for this chapter

Empowering and warm. The reader has learned the fundamentals. Now they're invited to use that knowledge. This isn't a call to action — it's a gentle welcome. The web is still open, still simple at its core, and still waiting for them to participate.

### Closing

End with a callback to the introduction: the web began as a simple exchange. It still is. Now you understand how it works, and you can decide how much of it you want to own.
