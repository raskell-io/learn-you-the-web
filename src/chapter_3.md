## The Place That Answers

> **Metaphor:** A library or shop
> **Mental image:** "This is where the pages live."

### Key Ideas

Now that the reader understands requests and responses, we zoom out slightly. What *is* this thing that's answering?

**Core concepts to cover:**

1. **A server is just a computer that waits**
   - It's not a special device — it's software running on a machine
   - Its job: listen for requests, send back responses
   - Demystify the word "server" — it serves, like a waiter or a librarian

2. **Files on a shelf**
   - At its simplest, a web server is a program that knows where files live
   - When you ask for `/about.html`, it finds that file and sends it back
   - This is called "static" serving — the files don't change based on who asks

3. **The server as a patient shopkeeper**
   - Open for business, waiting for visitors
   - Doesn't reach out to you — you have to come to it
   - Many customers can visit at once, each gets their own response

4. **Where do servers live?**
   - Your laptop can be a server (locally)
   - Data centers: warehouses full of servers
   - The "cloud" is just someone else's computer — demystify the term

5. **What a server doesn't do**
   - It doesn't display pages (that's the browser's job)
   - It doesn't know who you are unless you tell it
   - It doesn't remember previous requests by default (statelessness — light touch)

### Tone for this chapter

Warm and grounding. The server should feel accessible — something anyone could run if they wanted to. The metaphor of a small shop or library works well. Not a fortress, not a mystery — just a place.

### Bridge to Chapter 4

We've met the browser (the asker), the server (the answerer), and seen the exchange. But how do they understand each other? That's HTTP — the shared language.
